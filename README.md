## Challange
https://harrisonzhu508.github.io/Documentation/brooklyn_with_map.html

This dataset contains the house sales record in Brooklyn, New York City, from 2003 to 2017. It is a conbination of two datasets from the NYC Rolling Sales and the PLUTO files, which are merged and presented here as a single .csv file. It has 353546 rows and 111 features, where we are interested in predicting sale_price using other covariates.



## Progress
Only the preliminary data-preprocessing was done in the hackathon in one and half days
